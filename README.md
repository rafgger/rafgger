## 📚 About Me

I’m a developer & researcher passionate about building **intelligent systems** that bridge the gap between **theory and real-world applications**.  
Currently working on [TimeFlow - AI Time Tracking](https://time-flow-wheat.vercel.app/)
My journey started in **financial and insurance mathematics**, evolved into **mathematical engineering**,  
and culminated in a **PhD** on *Poisson–gamma modeling with dependency in the prior parameter*. Worked in an **AI projekt** with RAG and depeloped **Web Applications**.

I combine **mathematical rigor** with **software engineering** to craft AI systems that actually work — not just in theory.

## 🔭 Current Focus

- **AI + Vector Databases** — building **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipelines
- **Multimodal Knowledge Bases** — integrating **images + text** for better context understanding
- **OpenAI API & LLMs** — using large language models for reasoning, summarization, and search
- **Python & TypeScript** — developing end-to-end applications from backend logic to web interfaces
